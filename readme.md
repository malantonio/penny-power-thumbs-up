# penny power thumbs up/down harvester

This started as a project to harvest `pdf`s from the local Bucks County Penny Power circular for 
**Thumbs Up / Thumbs Down** entries, which salute and/or wag a finger at local happenings. I was
hoping to turn it into a Twitter bot, but the next week the pages were posted as `jpeg`s and kinda
killed it for me.
